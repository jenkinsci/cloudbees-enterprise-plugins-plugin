    The most flexible installation starts by setting up the CloudBees update center. \
    This includes all the OSS plugins available on the default update center, plus the Enterprise plugins. \
    After the update center metadata has been downloaded, the CloudBees license plugin will be installed, and Jenkins scheduled for restart. \
    After the restart you will be prompted for a license. \
    You can then install further Enterprise plugins \u00e0 la carte: \
    use <i>Manage Jenkins \u00bb Manage Plugins \u00bb Available</i> and type <code>cloudbees</code> in the filter box.

    If you are using Jenkins Operations Center by CloudBees to manage Jenkins licenses, you cannot use the minimal installation. \
    You need to also install the Operations Center client plugins. \
    After the restart, when prompted to register this installation, you will have the additional option of connecting to an Operations Center server to receive your license.

    Or, you may install all Enterprise plugins now, as well as recommended OSS plugins. \
    This is the equivalent of running the Jenkins Enterprise WAR with all its bundled plugins. \
    (You can always disable some of these plugins later.) \
    The sequence is similar to the minimal install but many more plugins are downloaded and scheduled for installation.
