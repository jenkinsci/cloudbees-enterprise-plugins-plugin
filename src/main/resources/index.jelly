  This plugin converts an OSS installation to a Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees (JEBC) installation. JEBC has dozen+
  plugins that address issues in enterprise installations. Plugins include folders, validate merges, templates,
  roles-based access control, backup plugins and others (

  Additionally, you can use the HA component to make Jenkins highly available.<br />
  <b>Note:</b> As part of the installation process, you will require a valid license to use the CloudBees Enterprise
  plugins. An evaluation license can be obtained automatically. Once the evaluation license expires, you must either
  obtain a full license OR uninstall the plugins requiring such a license.
